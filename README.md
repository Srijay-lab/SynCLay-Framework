# Scene-Graph-Nuclei

All code is developed and tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.10

# Collect Masks

The semantic masks for the experiment can be collected by running the scripts inside ./preprocessing/ directory. From the home directory, type cd preprocessing. To construct masks for CoNiC dataset, run ./conic/collect_masks.py. Fill the respective paths for variables labelspath and outfolder. For PanNuke, run ./pannuke/collect_masks.py. Place paths to maskspath, typespath and output folder. 

# Training the model

Please place the paths and values for respective variables in parser and run the following command for training the framework:

python main.py

# Inference

To generate images from predefined cellular layouts from datasets,

run python main.py --mode test

To generate images from cellular layouts generated by the TheCoT framework,

run python main.py --mode thecot
